# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

## Local Development

### Option 1: Simple Start (Recommended)
```bash
npm start
```
This will:
- âœ… Check if frontend is built
- âœ… Build frontend if needed
- âœ… Start the server
- âœ… Open at http://localhost:5000

### Option 2: Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start both server and client in development mode with hot reload.

## Deployment

Your app is already configured for Render deployment! Just push to GitHub and Render will:
- âœ… Install dependencies
- âœ… Build the frontend
- âœ… Start the server

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "port already in use" error:
1. Find the process using port 5000: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`
2. Kill the process: `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`
3. Try `npm start` again

### If the frontend doesn't load:
1. Make sure you're visiting http://localhost:5000 (not 5173)
2. Check that client/dist folder exists
3. Run `npm run build` to rebuild frontend

## Your App Status

âœ… **Local Server**: Working perfectly (as shown in your terminal)
âœ… **Frontend Build**: Successfully built
âœ… **Render Configuration**: Ready for deployment
âœ… **Socket.IO**: Fully functional

You're all set! ðŸŽ‰
