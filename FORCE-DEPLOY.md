Great! If you want to serve your React frontend from `client/dist` (the standard production setup), here’s exactly what you need to do:

---

## 1. **Build the Frontend Locally**

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```
This will create a `client/dist` folder with your production-ready frontend.

---

## 2. **Update Your Server to Serve Static Files**

Edit your main server file (likely `server/app.js` or `server/server.js`) to serve the static frontend.  
**Replace the embedded HTML code with:**

```js
const path = require('path');
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist/index.html'));
});
```

- Make sure you remove or comment out the giant `res.send(...)` that serves the embedded HTML.

---

## 3. **Update Your Render Build & Start Commands**

In `render.yaml`, set:
```yaml
buildCommand: |
  npm install
  cd client
  npm install
  npm run build
  cd ..
startCommand: node server/app.js
```

---

## 4. **Commit and Push the Build Output**

You **must** commit the `client/dist` folder so Render can serve it:
```bash
git add client/dist
git commit -m "Add built frontend for production"
git push
```

---

## 5. **Deploy and Test**

- Push your changes.
- Watch the Render logs for errors.
- Visit your deployed site and verify the React app loads.
